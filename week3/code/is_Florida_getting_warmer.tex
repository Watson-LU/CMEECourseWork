    The code 'prob' showing nearly 0 possibility randomized temperature influence.
    Although the observed temperature is during a successive time-points, the comparison 
    between it and random time correlation showing that they have significant different.
    Thus, the 0.53 correlation inidcate the temperature has significant correlation with the years,
    which further indicate that Florida is getting warmer through the years. In addition, the
    graph below also showing the observed one is different with the random calculating one.

    This graphic showing that the observed correlation is larger than 0.5 which is nearly tend to 0.
