# Project name: Week2 practice work

## Brief Description
It's for the week2 practices and works.
The first work is dealing with four loops and comprehensions codes.
The second work is converting a code to make it a "module"like work.
The third work is debugging the Align sequence finding code and fix it.
The fourth work is solving the missing oaks problem.


## Languages
Generally use bash and ipython3 that work in the both terminal and VSC.

## Dependencies
generally no special packages.

## Installation
The practice runs with the basic commands, all installations are stored in the class bootcamp, no other special projects or packages required. 

## Project stucture and Usage

1.In the first practice, just run each py file (lc1.py/lc2.py/tuple.py/dictionary.py) to test how I use two ways (one is for loop and another is list comprehension) to get the value from old set and put them into the new one. For example: 
``` python
run lc1.py
```

2.In this practice, copy old file "cfexercoses1.py" into "cfexercises1_control_flow.py" add the comment on each function and finally set tests for all functions.


3.In this practice, add the read and write files command into the original align_seqs.py, change the name as align_seq_prac.py.  
```python
run align_seq_prac.py
```

4.In the final practice, use the code:
```python
import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
```
to check the place of bug. then use doctest to try each probable result and fix the code.
