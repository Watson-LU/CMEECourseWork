# (1) Use a list comprehension to create a list of month,rainfall tuples where
# the amount of rain was greater than 100 mm.
 
# (2) Use a list comprehension to create a list of just month names where the
# amount of rain was less than 50 mm. 

# (3) Now do (1) and (2) using conventional loops (you can choose to do 
# this before 1 and 2 !). 

# A good example output is:
#
# Step #1:
# Months and rainfall values when the amount of rain was greater than 100mm:
# [('JAN', 111.4), ('FEB', 126.1), ('AUG', 140.2), ('NOV', 128.4), ('DEC', 142.2)]
# ... etc.
