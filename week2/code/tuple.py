# Birds is a tuple of tuples of length three: latin name, common name, mass.
# write a (short) script to print these on a separate line or output block by species 
# 
# A nice example output is:
# 
# Latin name: Passerculus sandwichensis
# Common name: Savannah sparrow
# Mass: 18.7
# ... etc.

# Hints: use the "print" command! You can use list comprehensions!
